# BUBBLE SORT - BASIC RUBY | THE ODIN PROJECT

Build a method #bubble_sort that takes an array and returns a sorted array. It must use the bubble sort methodology **(using #sort would be pretty pointless, wouldnâ€™t it?).**

```Ruby
bubble_sort([4,3,78,2,0,2])
=> [0,2,2,3,4,78]
```

## USAGE
- Enter **bubble_sort(list_of_numbers: Array)**
  - list_of_numbers = This is where you put your array that contains non organized/sorted list
