[4,3,78,2,0,2]

 4 > 3 ? Yes then => [3, 4]

The way how bubble sort works is there will be 2 pointers.
Im going to iterate the amount of elements inside the array
then iterate again using the index of the first loop as reference
and the 2 pointers will point out the pair values in array.
those 2 pointers will be used to get the element number to compare
who is greater, the greater value will be shifted on the right, or
if its already on the right side, it will just stay what it was.
this iterations continues up to the last.
